                        <h3>American Bobtail</h3>
                        <p>The American Bobtail is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late 1960s.[1] It is most notable for its stubby "bobbed" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat's tail. This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation affecting the tail development, similar to that of a Manx cat.</p>

                        <p>Cyprus cats, also known as Cypriot cats, Saint Helen cats, and Saint Nicholas cats, are a landrace of domestic cat found across the island of Cyprus. A standardized breed is being developed from them; among cat fancier and breeder organizations, it is presently fully recognized by the World Cat Federation (WCF), with breeding regulated by the World Cat Congress (WCC)</p>

                        <p>The Exotic Shorthair is a breed of cat developed as a short-haired version of the Persian. The Exotic is similar to the Persian in many ways, including temperament and conformation, a flat nose and face with the exceptions of the short dense coat.In the late 1950s, the Persian was used as an outcross by some American Shorthair breeders.</p>

                    <h3>Cats(general)</h3>
                    
                    <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt pests such as rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]</p>
                   
                    <p>and their ability to hunt pests such as rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries</p>
                   
                    <p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.</p>
                   
                    <p> Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. It is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk.[7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>
                    
                    <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy.</p>

                        <h3>How Pets Contribute to Positive Mental Health</h3>
                        
                        <p>Most pet owners are clear about the immediate joys that come with sharing their lives with companion animals. However, many of us remain unaware of the physical and mental health benefits that can also accompany the pleasure of snuggling up to a furry friend. It’s only recently that studies have begun to scientifically explore the benefits of the human-animal bond.</p>
                        
                        <p>Pets have evolved to become acutely attuned to humans and our behavior and emotions. Dogs, for example, are able to understand many of the words we use, but they’re even better at interpreting our tone of voice, body language, and gestures. And like any good human friend, a loyal dog will look into your eyes to gauge your emotional state and try to understand what you’re thinking and feeling (and to work out when the next walk or treat might be coming, of course).

                        <h3>The Annual Cost of Pet Ownership</h3>
                        
                        <p>Do you have friends who—as soon as they moved into their first adult place of their own—immediately went out and got an adorable puppy or cat?</p>

                        <p>I sure do, because I was one of them. When I was 24 I moved into my first “real” apartment with my girlfriend (now wife), Lauren. We could barely afford the rent, but being young and overwhelmed by “playing family” for the first time, we adopted two kittens from a local animal shelter. Ten years later, we’ve lost one of the cats but the other, a raspy-breathed tortoise calico named Moose, is still in the family.</p>

                        <p>Along the way, we’ve spent thousands on food and veterinary care including a $2,000+ surgery that fell while Lauren was an even poorer law student.</p>
